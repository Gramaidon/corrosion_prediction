Web Streamlit prediction corrosion, from project Dago Engineering internship
This repository contains a Streamlit application designed to predict pipe corrosion using a semantic segmentation deep learning model. The application allows users to:
  1. Upload pipe images for analysis.
  2. Detect corrosion areas on the pipe images visually
  3. Display prediction results with an overlay on the original images for easier interpretation.

## Key Features
  - Real-time prediction: A pre-trained deep learning model is applied to the uploaded pipe images.
  - Interactive visualization: Segmentation results are displayed intuitively, highlighting corrosion areas        distinct from other pipe section
  - User-friendly interface: Built with Streamlit, this app offers a simple UI suitable for both technical and     non-technical users
